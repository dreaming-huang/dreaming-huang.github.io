excerpt: 'This paper proposes a multi-stage framework for text-driven physically based facial texture generation from images captured in uncontrolled real-world settings. By leveraging differentiable rendering and specially designed texture disentanglement regularization, the method trains a generative adversarial network for efficient PBR texture sampling. The model aligns its latent space with text embeddings for flexible, text-guided generation and employs an edge-aware Score Distillation Sampling (EASDS) loss to enhance the diversity and quality of the generated textures, removing the need for expensive, controlled capture environments.'
