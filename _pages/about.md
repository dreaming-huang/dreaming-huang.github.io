## About Me

I am a Master's student in Software Engineering at the [State Key Lab of CAD&CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/#), Zhejiang University, fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Weiwei Xu. My primary research interests lie in **Generative Models (AIGC)**, **Computer Graphics**, and **Computer Vision**.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Yunnan University in 2023.
